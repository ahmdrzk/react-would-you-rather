A simple game. This project is required by Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

## üìù Description

‚ú¥Ô∏è **Users Can Do The Following**:

- Sign in by selecting a user from a predefined list / Sign out
- View answered and unanswered questions arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom)
- Create new questions by submitting a question text and two options
- Answer questions by voting for an option from two options provided for each question (answers can be submitted for one time only)
- View the results of questions answered by the signed-in user (users can't view the results of unanswered questions)
- The results of questions represent the number and percentage of votes given to each option
- View a leaderboard that is ranking the users in descending order by their score (score = answered questions count + created questions count)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
